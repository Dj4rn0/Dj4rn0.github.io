                <h1>Paper prototyping</h1>
                <p>For this project we were split into groups of 4 to 5 people. <br> We made a concept for a game not knowing what was next <br> after concepting a tiny game we were told we had to make "paper prototypes",<br> naturally we thought we had to do some work with cutting paper and stuff. <br> after we cut up the cards to match our player character we were told the playing cards were ment for... <br> playing the cards not cutting them up into pieces to look like something else. <br> This was a pretty funny twist but we continued with normal paper anyway otherwise we wouldn't have had a finished product. <br> We ended up making a 2d arena where you had to dodge incoming snakes (operated by another player) to survive. <br> So we finished the paper prototype and presented it expecting some bad feedback, <br> due to it being lackluster compared to other projects which were full fledged card and board games. <br> But no! We actually got pretty good feedback like; "Creative twist" and "I like the idea, reminds me of cuphead". <br> So it all turned out okay and we were quite happy with the end result.

              <h1>The five-wing project</h1>
              <p>This was a pretty big project but I decided to put it in the small project category because, <br> the plan was to make it a huge game that showcased everything I made, kind of like a portfolio but in a game. <br> This was an awesome idea but I simply did not have enough time to make it the way I wanted to. <br> I wanted to make a hotel with multiple floors and every floor was labeled a different name kind of like the seven deadly sins but in a positive way. <br> Due to me not having enough time to get all of this done before the strict deadline <br> I had to settle to put everything on 1 floor, and giving each word a room <br> Still really dissapointed I never finished it the way I intend to so one day <br> I will find some free time to work on it again and put it in the Big project category. <br> Here's one of the projects I showed in the room "Growth". <br> I put this image in that room because this is the first website I ever made and I could tell I improved on creating websites. <br> My skill in creating websites is obviously not perfect yet but everybody starts somewhere. <br> The text on the image says <b> "Hello! I'm Djarno the 17 year old nerd that this website will be about." </b>

            <p>This is the first time we were introduced to javascript and I had to make any screensaver of my choice in the program,<br> I chose to follow a perlin noise tutorial and make a little screensaver out of it, <br> it ended up looking like this:
