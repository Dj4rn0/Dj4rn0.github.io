    <h2><b>About Me ðŸ‘‹</b></h2>
    <p>I am a passionate Dutch 19 year old software developer, with a keen eye to learn more about game development / web development and programming in general. I currently study at Sintlucas Eindhoven at MBO level also known as the intermediate vocational level. I always love trying to create something unique. My skills include C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more. I am constantly learning and improving my skills to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the industry. As of lately I've been practicing VR development a lot.</p>

      <h3><b>Willow - Global Game Jam</b></h3>
      <img src="images/Willow.JPG" alt="Willow Project Image" class="project-image">
      <p>For this project, a few classmates and I flew to Spain to participate in the Global Game Jam hosted in Malaga. The Game Jam's theme was "Roots", and I may not have won the competition, but I am very happy with the project I delivered.</p>

      <h3><b>Perlin Noise - Javascript</b></h3>

      <p>With this project, we had to work with a program called "Processing 4." It's a sketchbook software with a focus on visual aspects. Our specific assignment was to make a screensaver using this program, and I made one using Perlin noise shaping.</p>

      <h3><b>Guilt - Roblox Game</b></h3>
      <img src="images/Guilt.JPG" alt="Guilt Project Image" class="project-image">
      <p>With this project, I wanted to try something different, using a completely different coding language for a game. This may not have been the best choice of code language due to its limitations to a small selection of game engines, but it was still new to me.</p>

      <img src="images/AgentSharp.JPG" alt="Gameplay Exam Project Image" class="project-image">
      <p>In my second education year, we have to follow two subjects of choice, my subjects being Gameplay and Agile Game Production. For Gameplay, our exam was to create a game design document for a random game of choosing, and this is what I created. I got a well-above passing grade for it.</p>
