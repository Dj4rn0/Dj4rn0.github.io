    <h2><b>About Me ðŸ‘‹</b></h2>
    <p>I am a passionate software developer with a keen eye to learn more about game development / web development and programming in general. I currently study at Sintlucas Eindhoven at MBO level also known as the intermediate vocational level. I always love trying to create something unique. My skills include C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more. I am constantly learning and improving my skills to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the industry. As of lately I've been practicing VR development a lot.</p>

    <h2><b>Projects</b></h2>
    <div class="project">
      <h3><b>Willow - Global Game Jam</b></h3>
      <p>For this project, a few classmates and I flew to Spain to participate in the Global Game Jam hosted in Malaga. The Game Jam's theme was "Roots", and I may not have won the competition, but I am very happy with the project I delivered.</p>

        <h3><b>Perlin Noise - Javascript</b></h3>
        <video src="images/perlinnoise.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>With this project we had to work with a program called "Processing 4" It's a sketchbook software with a focus on visual aspects. Our specific assignment was to make a screensaver using this programm and I made one using perlin noise shaping</p>

      <h3><b>2D Platformer - Arcade Machine</b></h3>
      <p>This project was for a school assignment. We had to create a 2D platformer game with some unique features to be displayed on Arcade Machines in our school. I made use of Unity's physics system to create a falling spikeball enemy, and I also added the option for the player to shoot a second type of bullet.</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h3><b>Guilt - Roblox Game</b></h3>
        <p>With this project, I wanted to try something different, using a completely different coding language for a game. This may not have been the best choice of code language due to its limitations to a small selection of game engines, but it was still new to me.</p>
